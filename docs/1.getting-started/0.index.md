## New to Shopify checklists

Checklists are available to help you track your progress creating your Shopify store. A general setup checklist can help ensure that your store is fully set up before you open to customers. If you're migrating to Shopify from another platform, then the migration checklist can help you transition your customer, product, and order information to Shopify.

Specialized checklists for setting up restaurants or grocery stores are also available.
